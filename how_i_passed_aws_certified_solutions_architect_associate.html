        <p>
          I should had written this blog in January, when I passed the exam, but
          I was focused on coding so ended up delaying til now. There is lock
          down going on due to Corona virus so why not resume my blog? So I
          passed AWS CPP exam by the end of August then on first week of
          September, I started my first developer job. I was super excited and
          nervous. Contract clearly stated that I'm on probation for 3 months
          and I can be terminated at any time. I was happy that I was able to
          find a full time developer job in a month after I graduated from
          bootcamp, but now I had to survive. I was faced with unfamiliar stack
          like AngularJS, Node.js, Redis, Cassandra and more. There was
          absolutely no time to study anything but angular in first month of the
          job. In order to say I understand the basics of AWS, I knew I had to
          pass at least Solutions Architect Associate exam. It was always stuck
          in back of my head. After 2 months on the job, I felt more comfortable
          with balancing life and work. By November, I was ready for another
          battle with AWS.

          First the content was definitely much bigger in Solution Architect
          Associte. I knew it was going to take serious efforts. I'm amazed how
          some people post how they passws SAA exam in less than a month on
          reddit. I knew I wasn't one of those, but that's okay. I'll keep
          persistent and move forward at my own pace, I told myself. Once again,
          I took no prisoner when it came down to investing in study materials.
          From WhizLab, Neal Davis Notes& Exam, Andrew Brown's SAA course, AWS
          Study Guide, Linux Academy and Jon Bonso's practice exam, I studied
          them all. It was overkill, but I that's the way I do.

        <p>
          Here I'll provide short breakdown of each of the study materials. 
          <br>
          1.Linux Academy- Over whopping 54 hours of videos. It comes with
          interactive diagram and flashcards. Video course is thorough. However,
          question pool for final exam is not big enough. Quality of question is
          not comparable to actual exam. This is only downside. However, if you
          are interested in DevOps, this is best study material you'll find
          especially after Cloud Guru bought them off. They provide study
          materials for all DevOps related exam. 
          <br>
          2. Neal Davis Notes& Exam- Pretty detailed notes, but better to read after you are familiar with
          materials. Exam is brutal as expected. If you can get 70% on his exam,
          you'll have no problem passing actual exam. There are six practice
          tests. 
          <br>
          3. WhizLab Tests- I only used their practice tests and they are
          easier than Jon Bonso and Neal Davis, but still worth it. Valuable one
          is sectional test that test your knowledge per subject like Dynamo DB
          and ELB. 
          <br>
          4. Jon Bonso Practice Tests- If you go over reddit on how to
          pass AWS exam, you'll this guy name all over the place. There is a
          reason. His practice tests resemble the actual exam except his exam is
          slighly more difficult. Extremely thorough explanation on the solution
          is what separates his practice tests from others. It's like full study
          notes and exam combined. This is a must have. Only $13CAD in udemy.
          Can't go wrong. 
          <br>
          5. Andrew Brown SAA video course- It's available for
          free. It's made of chains of short videos and he gets right to the
          point. His cheats sheets are well summarized and helps you refresh the
          materials you learnt. I used this course at the last stage of my exam
          preparation and helped immensely.

          I did read couple of whitepapers and FAQS for important services. As
          far as what you need to study, there is nothing surprising. Instead of
          focusing on each individual AWS service, try to focus on how each
          service interact with each other like relationship between ELB and
          auto-scaling, DynamoDB and API Gateway. It was tough journey, but well
          worth it. After passing AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam, I was
          going for my 3rd AWS certification by studying for Developer
          Associate, but I'm junior developer and I don't get to use AWS in my
          work. So I thought it would be better for me to get my focus back to
          pure coding. I felt that I was stretching out myself too thin.
          However, I am planning to create MEAN stack app as side project and
          deploy on AWS using various services like Elastic Beanstalk or
          serverless technology like Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway. Not quite
          sure where my coding journey will go from here, but as long as I
          continue learning, I know that my hard work will eventually pay off.
