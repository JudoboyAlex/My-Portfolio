          It has been 3 years since I wrote my last blog. I have decided to
          write another one. As a frontend engineer, it's a must to be
          knowledgeable and proficient at web accessibility. Since my manager
          said company is willing to compensate me for writing exam, I said why
          not? I have passed numerous cloud exams after all. Last month I got a
          news that I passed CPACC exam üéâ I have taken two courses to prepare
          for the exam: famous Deque prep and Princeton University course. They
          were both paid by my employer, Ceridian. Condition was that I need to
          pass the exam to get refunded. Expensive exam fee was refunded as
          well. Due to this expense, I was under a lot of pressure when
          preparing for the exam. Brainscape flashcards helped to refresh my
          memory. I paid for one month. I never wrote my own note. I'm too lazy
          for that üòù What differentiate Princeton University course from Deque
          is that they provide practice exam. I'm a big fan of doing multiple
          practice exams before actual exam. It's the best way to confirm your
          knowledge. However, actual exam was more difficult, but it does help
          to study prep courses from both providers. I studied about 2 months. I
          thought exam can't be too hard since it's multiple choices. I'm used
          to multiple choices exams from AWS and Azure. Studying consistently is
          the key to success.

          Finally, when the exam date arrived, I drove to the exam center and
          luckily it wasn't much of a hassle. I decided to write the exam at
          exam center because I heard so many horror stories of writing exam at
          home virtually. The exam center was less than impressive. Building
          looked 100 years old... very shabby. Anyway, I proceeded to enter the
          building. I was on a mission. While writing exam, I had to endure the
          heating blowing right in my face. I wrote it in November in Toronto so
          weather was quite cold. I could feel my eyeballs drying out. Exam
          itself was more challenging than I expected. International laws and
          regulations weren't tough part. It was where they describe certain
          disability and making correct guess on which disability was the tricky
          part. After completing the exam, I thought it was going to be close
          call.

          After waiting for 2 months üò´, I finally got the news that I passed
          the exam! Little surprised, but I'll take the result. I'm not sure if
          I will take WAS exam or not, which will qualify me to become a CPWA.
          For now I'll keep on practicing creating accessible components.
