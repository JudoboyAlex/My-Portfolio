          This is my official first blog ever. Aside from trying to crank up
          SEO, I would like to share my experince of my AWS journey as I found
          it helpful when I read about how other people prepared for their AWS
          exam. I didn't know anything about AWS until I started job search for
          my first developer job after finishing coding bootcamp in Toronto. For
          almost every developer job description, there was a word AWS as "Nice
          to have" or "Preferred" section. I thought Amazon was only online
          retailer. What do they have to do with cloud technology and why is it
          so important to know this in Toronto? It wasn't until I met Andrew
          Brown from ExamPro during meet up on "How to maximize your profile on
          linkedin" that my curiosity on AWS took off. Even though meetup was
          about how to tailor your linkedin profile to attract developer jobs,
          the conversation lead to AWS since he had all 11 AWS certifications
          which showed on his profile. He mentioned although junior developers
          don't really need certification, if I want I can start off with AWS
          Certified Cloud Practioner, which is considered entry level of AWS
          certification. It was good way to separate myself from the rest of
          junior developers I thought. Every time I try to apply on linkedin, I
          see the number 200 applicants that applied before me. I have to do
          something different. Thus, my AWS journey begins.

          Andrew was kind enough to provide me free access to his ExamPro course
          for CCP(Certified Cloud Practioner). Course was nicely designed, but
          since I was total noob, it was taking some time to digest. I knew I
          was going to need more resources if I want to pass the exam. I googled
          and found Linux Academy and Cloud Guru to be popular resources for not
          only cloud but other devops related certifications. I bought Linux
          Academy CCP Exam preparation course for $13 CAD in Udemy. I found
          video course was easy to follow and liked the diagram that came along.
          I also read free notes provided by Neal Davis' Digital Cloud Training
          site. They were very detailed, but I always liked reading books when I
          study for something so I bought his notes. That book made big
          difference. All video courses I watched started making sense as I read
          the book. But Neal Davis Practice Tests were nasty. If I was getting
          80% on Linux Academy practice exam, I would get 60s in his. Practice
          tests are absolute must. I took mutiple practice tests from different
          providers just to make sure I can get a good mark consistently. I take
          no prisoners when it comes to self-investment so I invested in about 5
          different study providers.

          The pattern of my study was to watch all the video courses, read study
          notes then do practice tests multiple times then read study notes
          again then do practice tests until I get over 80%. A lot of people
          make their own study notes, but I felt there was no need as Neal Davis
          study notes covered entire topics in a concise manner. After studying
          for 2 weeks full-time, I felt confident so I booked exam in following
          week. To pass the actual exam I needed 72% grade. But my grades from
          practice tests were all over the place. I was getting 50 to 60s in
          Neal Davis and AWS Official Study Guide, but in ExamPro and Linux
          Academy, I had no problem clearing 80s. As exam day approached, I
          noticed I was geting anxious. All I could do was kept grinding...I
          believe in hard work. At the end of August 2019, I took my first AWS
          CCP exam. At the end of exam, I had mixed emotion. I had flagged 20
          questions where I wasn't 100% confident about answer. But I need at
          least 47 out of 65 to pass so I kind of panicked. After final review,
          I pressed that Submit button. The feeling was unreal when I saw that
          "Congratulation! You Passed!" message. All the hard work paid off.
          This is how I got my first IT certification and I know there are more
          to come. Since CCP is foundational level, you just need to understand
          all AWS services at high level without going into too details. It
          gives you an good introduction to AWS. As long as you put efforts in reading
          and doing practice tests, you can clear this in a month.
